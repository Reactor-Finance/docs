# AMM V2

Reactor's V2 AMM is based on UniV2 constant formula, with a custom implementation of a Solidly-type logic for stables.

The Reactor AMM is the core of our ecosystem-oriented approach, designed with the following principles in mind:

* A high level of flexibility and customization
* An optimized trading efficiency for users
* Providing support to protocols' growth by adapting to their needs

This reflection led us to develop our AMM V2, which includes a dual-liquidity model for our pairs and introduces dynamic directional fees as well as a swap referral mechanism for partnering apps.
