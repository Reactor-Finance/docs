  Assuming that one size does not fit all, we provide adjustable swap fees based

# Dynamic directional fees

## Dynamic & directional <a href="#dynamic-and-directional" id="dynamic-and-directional"></a>

Reactor pairs can be configured with their own swap fees, but it's also possible for each of them to be set up with **different values depending on the swap direction** (buying or selling).

As a result, we have the freedom to incentivize every pair differently, depending on the volatility or stability of its assets, as well as on the structure of protocols and their own custom needs (an established project seeking to reduce friction, a newly launched project aiming to stabilize and limit selling pressure, etc...).

## Fees handling delegation <a href="#fees-handling-delegation" id="fees-handling-delegation"></a>

Each project launching on our AMM and willing to work with us can have its LPs configured with specific swap rates tailored to suit its own strategy.

Ultimately, we intend to provide the possibility for partnering protocols to directly take control of their own pairs' swap fees.
