# A Next Generation Unified Marketplace

Reactor is eliminating the significant inefficiency, value extraction and complex UX that is associated with multiprotocol DEX ecosystems.

Through a native voting incentives marketplace coupled to the Reactor and quality of life upgrades like the automatic max-lock feature, Reactor can consolidate all of the functions that drive the entire Curve & Convex ecosystems within a single protocol to offer a better user experience for all users.

### Removing the LP Boost.

We are taking the best of ve-tokenomics and removing the inefficiencies. The LP boost enables veTOKEN holders (like veCRV or veBAL) to earn up to 2.5x more rewards according to the relative holdings of a users veTOKEN balance and LP position size. Given that both the Curve and Balancer ecosystems have had time to establish we can observe a number of problems.

As a liquidity marketplace for protocols, we want to maximise governance decentralisation by ensuring that all protocols can have an equitable opportunity to benefit from RCT emissions.

The LP boost across both Curve and Balancer has ensured that a meta-protocol (Convex and Aura) owns most of the veTOKEN supply.&#x20;

As 60% of emissions are allocated to boosted pools, these meta layers end up controlling the majority of supply allocation, governance power and charge additional fees for access.&#x20;

This is inefficient and value extractive by design, and what we can see is that these systems converge onto all participants earning the same boost levels, which makes the entire system redundant.
