# What is ve(3,3)?

## _ve(3,3)_ <a href="#undefined" id="undefined"></a>

[Andre Cronje](https://x.com/AndreCronjeTech) revolutionized exchanges by creating a system where all participants are incentivized to act in the best interest of each other and the exchange. While not perfect, it was a huge step forward as a means to align incentives with participants. **To understand ve(3,3), we need to break down two key concepts:**

### Rebase <a href="#rebase" id="rebase"></a>

A core element of the ve(3,3) model was the rebasing of locked positions to prevent a user from being diluted by emissions, [OHM (3,3)](https://www.olympusdao.finance/). This anti-dilution mechanic for veTOKEN holders allowed them to **maintain the same ownership without having to buy and lock more tokens.**

### Vote Escrow (ve) <a href="#vote-escrow-ve" id="vote-escrow-ve"></a>

The second concept you should understand is vote escrow **(ve)** - a fundamental change to governance and on-chain voting systems that introduced **time-weighted voting.**

> Instead of voting with token amount **a**, tokens are lockable in a _VotingEscrow_, now shown as **veA**, for a selectable locktime

Your vote is not only calculating total tokens held, but also the lock duration. Curve first introduced this in a 2020 [whitepaper](https://classic.curve.fi/files/CurveDAO.pdf).

This system intentionally creates a **risk vs. reward** scenario. where more governance power is given to active participants continually extending their locks.
