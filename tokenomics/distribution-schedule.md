To ensure that `$RCT` tokenomics is sustainable long-term, most of the `$RCT` token inflation (from liquidity, treasury, public sale, etc.) will end within 1 year from the token launch.

After 12 months from TGE, roughly 42% of the token supply will be in circulation. The remaining will be released using exponential decay.
