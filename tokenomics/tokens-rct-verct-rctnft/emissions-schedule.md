# Emissions Schedule

### **ve(3,3) Dynamics** <a href="#ve-3-3-dynamics" id="ve-3-3-dynamics"></a>

The main stakeholders of a typical AMM (on Monad Chain), including `veRCT` holders, LPs, users, and protocols, are all aligned by the ve(3,3) dynamics that determine RCT emissions.

**`veRCT` holders** — are incentivized to vote either for the highest volume pools (because the greater the volume, the greater the amount of fees produced as a result), or the ones on which protocols have deposited voting incentives to bootstrap their liquidity. This allows these protocols to create positive feedback loop, if the token generates strong volume.

**Liquidity Providers (LPs)** — are incentivized with emissions driven by “Real Yield” based metrics.

**Traders** — benefit from the low slippage thanks to the liquidity provided, in concert with the latest and greatest battle-tested vAMM / sAMM tech.

**Protocols** — have access to a cooperation oriented liquidity layer. They benefit from capital efficient trading conditions for their tokens, and they can incentivize their liquidity via bribes offered to `veRCT` holders.
