# Protocol Airdrop

The protocol and community airdrop marks a monumental leap for Reactor. This pivotal event is set to catalyze the influx of substantial TVL and governance wars as we embark on a journey to onboard new partners into the Monad Ecosystem. Simultaneously, we'll be enticing certain communities to become part of the Reactor family.

## `veRCT` **Protocol Airdrop**

A significant 30% of our initial supply has been exclusively allocated for protocol airdrop that exhibit a genuine enthusiasm for engaging with our robust liquidity layer.&#x20;

Our selection criteria encompass crucial factors such as TVL, trade volumes, prospects of future collaboration, and the quality of the product. In addition, we're steadfast in achieving equilibrium between Monad based protocols and projects hailing from other blockchain networks.

Protocols are encouraged to take part in a virtuous cycle by reinvesting their earned emissions into incentives for their gauges, thereby attracting more liquidity. This strategy contributes to a self-sustaining ecosystem.
