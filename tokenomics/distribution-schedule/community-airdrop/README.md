## Airdrop Allocation Overview

To promote long-term protocol alignment, 12% of Reactor’s initial token supply has been allocated for strategic airdrops. This ensures the protocol’s early supporters are rewarded while fostering a committed user base.

**Allocation Breakdown:**

* 6% – Engaged users from Reactor
* 3% - Engaged users from partner communities Under Monad ecosystems
* 3% – Engaged users from veTOKEN partner communities:

For Partner communities in other chain: Our selection criteria encompass crucial factors such as TVL, trade volumes, prospects of future collaboration, and the quality of the product. In addition, we're steadfast in achieving equilibrium between Monad based protocols and projects hailing from other blockchain networks.

Protocols are encouraged to take part in a virtuous cycle by reinvesting their earned emissions into incentives for their gauges, thereby attracting more liquidity. This strategy contributes to a self-sustaining ecosystem.
