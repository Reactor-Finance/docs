# Reactor Points (Testnet)



Reactor Points are user-focused airdrop rewards earned through the Community Airdrop program. Designed to drive growth and strengthen Reactor's ecosystem, this program positions Reactor as a premier hub for DeFi enthusiasts, empowering users to maximize their asset potential on Monad..

To qualify for the airdrop, you will need to earn Reactor Points by swap, add Liquidity, and refer your friends to Reactor. These points will be distributed as [#long-term-ecosystem-impact](./#long-term-ecosystem-impact "mention") , ensuring long-term sustainability and preventing sudden shifts in supply.

## How can I earn Reactor Points?

1. Swap: Trade eligible assets.
2. **Liquidity Provision**: Provide liquidity into pools.
3. Referral: Refer your friends.

## Eligible Assets

1. Swap
   * All pair
2. Liquidity
   * RCT/MON
   * RCT/USDC
   * RCT/ETH
   * RCT/USDT
   * MON/USDC
   * MON/USDT
   * MON/YAKI
   * MON/CHOG
   * MON/DAK
   * MON/shMON

## How many Reactor Points do I receive for each activity?

1. Swap: You will earn 1 point for every $5 traded. For example, if you were to swap $100 in MON into USDT/USDC, you will earn 20 points. Also note that even if only one of the assets is an eligible asset when swapping (i.e., swapping Token 0 to Token 1 when only Token 0 is an eligible asset), you will still receive the full points for that swap transaction.
2. Liquidity Providers: You can provide liquidity into eligible pools to earn Points. The USD value of your liquidity position is calculated hourly to determine your points earned for that 1 hour. For example, if you were to provide $100 of liquidity, you will receive 20 Points/hour..
