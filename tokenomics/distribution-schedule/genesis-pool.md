# Genesis Pool

Genesis pools were created to serve as exclusive farms for early adopters. To promote long-term protocol alignment, 12% of Reactor’s initial token supply has been allocated for Genesis Pool. This ensures the protocol’s early supporters are rewarded while fostering a committed user base.

**Allocation Breakdown:**

* 8% – Reactor Points holder (Mainnet) will receive 8,000,000 tokens that will be distributed proportionally to early adopters who bootstrapped liquidity on Reactor during the Open Beta.
* 4% – Will be allocated to voters on the RCT/USDC, RCT/MON and MON/USDC pairs.
