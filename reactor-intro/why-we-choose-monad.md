# Why we choose Monad?

[<mark style="color:purple;">Monad</mark>](https://monad.xyz/) is a cutting-edge Ethereum-compatible Layer 1 blockchain designed for exceptional performance without compromising decentralization. By addressing key limitations of existing blockchain infrastructures, Monad sets a new standard for scalability, speed, and efficiency. Here’s why Monad stands out:

### 1. Decentralization Matters

Decentralization is the cornerstone of blockchain technology, ensuring security, censorship resistance, and global accessibility. While many solutions compromise decentralization for speed, Monad achieves both by leveraging advanced optimizations without cutting corners.

### Solving Today’s Performance Bottlenecks

Ethereum faces constraints like single-threaded execution, inefficient storage access, and state growth concerns, limiting its scalability. Monad tackles these challenges with groundbreaking innovations:

* **MonadBFT:** A pipelined, HotStuff-based consensus mechanism with advanced research improvements.
* **Deferred Execution:** Decouples consensus from execution, maximizing efficiency.
* **Parallel Execution:** Utilizes multi-core systems for concurrent transaction processing.
* **MonadDb:** A high-performance storage backend optimized for efficient state updates.

### Exceptional Performance

Monad achieves 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) with 1-second block times and single-slot finality. This throughput—1 billion transactions per day—supports mass adoption and reduces transaction costs, making it ideal for high-frequency, high-volume applications.

### Familiarity and Portability

Monad is fully compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem:

* **EVM Compatibility:** Supports the full Ethereum bytecode standard, allowing seamless migration of Ethereum applications without code changes.
* **Ethereum RPC API:** Integrates with familiar tools like MetaMask, Phantom, and Etherscan.
* **Address Space:** Matches Ethereum’s address system, enabling users to reuse existing keys and wallets.

This compatibility ensures that developers and users can easily transition to Monad while leveraging the wealth of existing Ethereum infrastructure and applications.

### Innovations That Drive Scalability

Monad introduces several groundbreaking features to enhance performance:

* **Parallel Execution:** Transactions are executed concurrently while maintaining deterministic outcomes. Inputs and outputs are validated to ensure consistency.
* **Superscalar Pipelining:** Inspired by efficient workflows, Monad optimizes resource utilization by processing multiple stages simultaneously.
* **Deferred Execution:** Consensus on transaction order is reached before execution, increasing the available execution time for each block.
* **MonadDb:** Ensures rapid state updates and efficient data access with in-memory caching and SSD optimization.
