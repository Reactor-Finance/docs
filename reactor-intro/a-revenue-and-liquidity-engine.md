# A Revenue & Liquidity Engine

Reactor will accelerate the advent of a DeFi economy on Abstract where real value is generated and distributed within an open and permissionless economic system that is underlined by robust and immutable code.

The power of the MetaDEX model pioneered by Aerodrome & Velodrome shows that it is the most effective infrastructure to bring users, revenue and protocol liquidity growth.

Reactor will provide highly efficient liquidity pools that enable low slippage token swaps for traders, that are driven by a self-optimising incentives system that drives deep liquidity and trading demand for protocols and for core ecosystem pools like USDC/T/WETH & MON/WETH, and revenue for veRCT voters.
