# Genesis Farms

{% endhint %}

The Genesis farms are based on our existing pool reward structure. You can think of them as exclusive farms for early adopters.

Genesis farms are designed to bootstrap the initial liquidity for Reactor before our token goes live and provide the community with an early and attractive opportunity to accumulate `veRCT` .

In some cases, genesis farms will distribute not only `veRCT`, but also incentives from a second token, usually directly provided by a partner protocol.

{% hint style="danger" %}
But even more interesting: when regular farming rewards are live, the genesis stakers **will simultaneously cumulate genesis AND farming rewards, making it extra profitable!**
{% endhint %}

Genesis pools will progress according to the following timeline: (4pm UTC for each stage)

* TBA

The Genesis farms will go live on ████, and deposits will remain open until ████ — after this point, deposits are no longer possible. Rewards for the genesis farms will begin from ████ and will be linearly distributed for six months.

{% hint style="info" %}
You'll be able to see your genesis rewards accumulate from ████, but won't be able to harvest them before ████.
{% endhint %}

## **How to calculate my rewards?** <a href="#how-to-calculate-my-rewards" id="how-to-calculate-my-rewards"></a>

5% of RCT's total supply has been allocated for the genesis pool rewards, guaranteeing high-yield returns. However, giving an accurate APR number will be initially impossible since RCT won't be priced yet.

Consequently, once live, every genesis farm will have a custom APR calculator allowing users to estimate their expected returns based on an estimated FDV.

Most importantly, once standard liquidity mining emissions go live after the public sale, genesis depositors will be earning both the farming rewards PLUS the genesis farm rewards and any additional bonus from locking their LPs.

To summarize, the genesis farm yields will be additional rewards on top of any base liquidity mining rewards we provide to the pools. This, therefore, enables a significant yield earning opportunity for early users.

## **Pool offering** <a href="#pool-offering" id="pool-offering"></a>

The main pools will consist of popular traded pairs on Monad. They will be split between "main" liquidity and launch partner pools that we'll progressively reveal until the effective start of the genesis.
